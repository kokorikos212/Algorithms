# Algorithms
The work you 'll see here is the outcome of my attendance in the Uoc's class design and analysis of algorithms. In form of classes i implemented two basic sorting algorithms: heap sort and merge sort. There is also a decorator for timing the performance of the two algorithms and a random set generator.
