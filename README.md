# Algorithms
The work you'll see here is the outcome of my attendance in the Uoc's class design and analysis of Algorithms. In the form of classes, I implemented two basic sorting algorithms: heap sort and merge sort. There is also a decorator for timing the performance of the two algorithms and a random set generator. You can easily extend the masterclass to include other sorting algorithms as well.
